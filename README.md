# Basic Node Server

This repository is a simple implementation of a basic node web server. It was created following codeSTACKr's youtube tutorial: [Node.js Crash Course for Beginners Tutorial - Learn Node Basics in 30 Minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LUdnb-mls0).

The server hosts a mock website, with web server routing, status codes, and redirects.
